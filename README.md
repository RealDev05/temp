# Understanding Value Education - Question and Answer Guide

## Basic Concepts and Educational Priorities

1. The expectations from education encompass two fundamental aspects:
   - Understanding 'what to do' (what is valuable as a human being)
   - Learning 'how to do' (skills and technology acquisition)

2. "What to do" refers to understanding what is valuable and meaningful as a human being. It involves making fundamental decisions about what is right, important, and worthwhile in our lives.

3. "How to do" refers to the technical and practical aspects of education - the skills, technologies, and methodologies we need to accomplish tasks effectively.

4. Both "what to do" and "how to do" are essential components of education. The lecture emphasizes that these two aspects complement each other and are both necessary for complete education.

5. The priority order between them should be:
   First: Understanding "what to do" through Value Education
   Second: Learning "how to do" through Technical Education

6. The purpose of value education is multi-faceted:
   - To help us understand "what to do" in life
   - To develop a holistic perspective
   - To enable independent decision-making about what is valuable
   - To help us become self-referential rather than dependent on others' judgments

7. Technical education is focused on the "how to do" aspect of learning, encompassing:
   - Skill development
   - Technology understanding and usage
   - Practical methodologies
   - Implementation techniques

8. In current day education, the priority has shifted heavily toward "how to do" (skills and technology), making education skill-biased, often at the expense of value understanding.

9. We are not practicing ethical use of knowledge in current times. Despite technological advancement, there's a gap in ensuring ethical application due to insufficient understanding of "what to do."

10. Not knowing "what to do" creates several problems:
    - Internal confusion and lack of clarity
    - Vulnerability to external influence
    - Engaging in others' agendas without clear personal direction
    - Inability to ensure ethical use of skills and knowledge

## Understanding Values and Decision-Making

11. Yes, "what to do" means what is valuable. These concepts are explicitly linked in the lecture as equivalent ideas.

12. The lecture presents this as a choice, but emphasizes the importance of deciding "what to do" in our own right rather than depending on others' judgments.

13. Current factors guiding "what to do" decisions often include:
    - Societal pressures
    - Group influences
    - Educational system directives
    - External programming

14. Deciding "what to do" based on others' opinions leads to:
    - Loss of self-referential thinking
    - Unconscious acceptance of others' values
    - Focusing solely on implementation without understanding purpose

15. Yes, we can decide "what to do" in our own right through proper value education and self-exploration.

16. Value education should convey:
    - Universal principles
    - Rational understanding
    - Naturally verifiable truths
    - All-encompassing perspective of human life
    - Ways to achieve harmony at all levels

## Understanding Value Concepts

17. Value of an object is defined as its participation in the larger order.

18. The value of chalk is its participation in the classroom, specifically its role in writing on the blackboard.

19. No, the value of an object is definite and does not change with time, person, or place. The lecture explicitly states this principle.

20. No, the chalk is not valuable when it scratches the board as this contradicts its proper participation in the larger order.

21. True. Value is also called role or participation in the larger order.

22. The value of chalk is its ability to write on the blackboard in the classroom setting.

23. Water is always valuable in its proper role. The lecture doesn't provide specific instances where water is not valuable, as it maintains that proper participation is always valuable.

24. Human value refers to a human being's participation in the larger order at various levels - individual, family, society, and nature/existence.

## Personal and Social Values

25. According to the lecture, respect is valuable as it leads to mutual happiness both for the one giving and receiving respect.

26. Your value in your family is determined by your participation and contribution to family harmony and well-being.

27. Living in accordance with human values achieves:
    i) In human-human relationships: Mutual happiness
    ii) In human-nature relationships: Mutual prosperity

28. Yes, values are universal - they apply to all humans regardless of sect, creed, nationality, race, or gender.

29. Yes, values are rational and amenable to logical reasoning rather than based on blind beliefs.

30. Yes, values are naturally verifiable through experience rather than being based on dogmas or assumptions.

31. Yes, values are experientially validated through personal verification and understanding.

32. "Values are all encompassing" means they cover all dimensions of human life (thought, behavior, work, and understanding) and all levels (individual, family, society, and nature/existence).

## Dimensions and Levels of Human Existence

33. The different dimensions of a human being are:
    - Understanding/Realization
    - Thought
    - Behavior
    - Work/Participation in larger order

34. The different levels of human being are:
    - Individual
    - Family
    - Society
    - Nature/Existence

35. Yes, value education can create harmony at all four levels of our being through proper understanding and application.

36. From society, we should expect trust/fearlessness rather than fear/mistrust.

37. In thoughts, we should expect clarity (state of resolution) rather than confusion (state of problem).

38. My value for myself involves ensuring happiness in the self and health in the body.

39. My value for family involves ensuring feelings of relationship and prosperity.

40. My value for society involves participating in social systems for justice, peace, and harmony.

41. My value for nature/existence involves achieving mutual fulfillment with the rest of nature.

## Process and Implementation

42. Our thoughts guide:
    - Understanding/Realization
    - Behavior
    - Work/Participation in the larger order

43. True. In value education, values are conveyed as proposals rather than imposed beliefs.

44. No, value education emphasizes not assuming anything but verifying everything through personal exploration.

45. The result of value education will be:
    - Self-referential thinking
    - Self-confidence
    - Clarity about what is valuable
    - Understanding of one's role at various levels

46. The purpose of value education is to initiate internal dialogue and help become self-referential and self-confident.

47. Value education starts with an external dialogue between teacher and student.

48. As value education proceeds, it creates an internal dialogue within oneself between what one is and what one naturally accepts as valuable.
